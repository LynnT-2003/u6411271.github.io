# I created a new repository, but unexpectedly the URL for the webpage became as shown: 
<h3>https://lynnt-2003.github.io/u6411271.github.io/products.html</h3><br><br>

<p>
I created a new repository for the midterm submission: https://github.com/LynnT-2003/u6411271.github.io.git <br>
I copied and modified the pre-existing from my classwork repository: https://github.com/LynnT-2003/LynnT-2003.github.io.git and cloned it in my newly created repo<br><br>
This was because my classwork repository got really messy with all sorts of files after using React 
and I got worried that it might cause confusions during submission. 
And as a result, my URL became nested, which I did not expect. <br><br>

The URL to my webpage is: https://lynnt-2003.github.io/u6411271.github.io/products.html<br>
The URL to my the repository I created for this midterm is: https://github.com/LynnT-2003/u6411271.github.io.git<br>
The URL to my classwork repository where I modified my code from is: https://github.com/LynnT-2003/LynnT-2003.github.io.git<br>
